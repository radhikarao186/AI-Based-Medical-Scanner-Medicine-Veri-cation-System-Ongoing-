# AI-Based-Medical-Scanner-Medicine-Verification-System-(Ongoing)
In the healthcare industry, the authentication of medicines and assessment of injuries are critical challenges. Fake or expired medicines can lead to severe health risks, while manual injury evaluation can be inconsistent and time-consuming.

To address these issues, we are developing an AI-powered Medical Scanner and Verification System that leverages Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to:

Analyze injury images to determine severity and provide grading.
Verify medicines by detecting fake or expired drugs.
This system aims to enhance medical safety, automate verification processes, and assist healthcare professionals with AI-driven insights.
